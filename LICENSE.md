## **1. EVALUATION LICENSE; TERM.**

This Agreement governs Evaluator’s access, installation, configuration and/or use of the Product.

### **1.1 Evaluation License.**

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Licensor hereby provides Evaluator, during the Term (as defined below), a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable right and license to internally evaluate the Product and to test Evaluator’s own applications that operate in connection with the Product, solely for the purpose of internally evaluating the performance and functionality of the Product (the “**License**”). For the avoidance of doubt, Evaluator may not disclose or use the Product or any components thereof on behalf of or in connection with any third party’s products, services, or research and development activities; provided that, upon Licensor’s prior written consent, Evaluator may use the Product in connection with Evaluator’s clients who are bound to an unmodified form of this Agreement with Licensor.

### **1.2 Source Code Rights.**

In connection with this Agreement, Licensor may make available for download certain files and software components of the Product in source code form (the “**Source Code Programs**”). Such Source Code Programs shall be subject to the License and other terms and conditions of this Agreement (including Section 3), provided that Evaluator may modify and create derivative works of the Source Code Programs (collectively, “**Improvements**”) solely for use in connection with its internal evaluation and testing as otherwise permitted herein. 

### **1.3 Term.**

Evaluator agrees to use and evaluate the Product for the period of time specified by Licensor in writing (including email), or if no such period is specified then for six (6) months after the date Evaluator accepts this Agreement (as described in the preamble above) (the “**Term**”).

## **2. FEEDBACK.**

During the Term, Evaluator may provide to Licensor feedback regarding the use, operation, performance, and functionality of the Product (“**Feedback**”). Such Feedback may include information about operating results, performance, known or suspected bugs, errors or compatibility problems and user-desired features. Evaluator hereby grants to Licensor a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, sublicenseable, and royalty-free right to use and otherwise exploit the Feedback in any manner.

Evaluator agrees that it will not: (i) except as expressly permitted in Section 1, reproduce, modify, distribute, disclose or make available to any third party any portion of the Product in any form; (ii) publish, license, sublicense, transfer or assign, in whole or in part, any portion of the Product; (iii) except with respect to the Source Code Programs, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any portion of the Product, or otherwise attempt to decrypt, extract or derive the source code for the software (or any parts thereof) embedded therein; (iv) access or use the Product in order to build a similar or competitive product or service; (v) publish or disclose to any third party any performance or benchmark tests or analyses or other non-public information relating to the Product or the use thereof; (vi) access or use the Product to develop, or introduce into the Product, any harmful or malicious code or programs, such as computer viruses, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware or other malware; or (vii) use in any applications in which failure of such Products could reasonably be expected to result in personal injury, loss of life or property damage, including any life sustaining, medical or nuclear use. The software is copyrighted and protected by the laws of the United States and other countries, and international treaty provisions. Evaluator shall not remove any copyright or other proprietary notices from the Product. Without limiting Licensor’s other rights or remedies, Evaluator agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Licensor and its affiliates and its and their employees, officers, directors, and agents harmless from and against any claims, losses, damages, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) to the extent arising from Evaluator’s breach of this Agreement.

Certain items of software code provided with the Product, or which are intended to be downloaded separately by Evaluator and used with the Product, are licensed from third parties and are subject to “open source” or “free software” licenses from such licensors (“**Third Party Code**”). The Third Party Code is licensed under the terms of the license that accompanies or otherwise is applicable to such Third Party Code. Nothing in this Agreement limits Evaluator’s rights under, or grants Evaluator rights that supersede, the terms and conditions of any applicable license for the Third Party Code, including any rights to copy, modify, or distribute Third Party Code under the applicable license.

Notwithstanding Section 4.1, Evaluator shall not use the Product in connection with any Free and Open Source Software (“FOSS”, as further defined below) in such a way that would require all or any part of the Product or any source code that incorporates or discloses any part of thereof to be: (i) disclosed or distributed in source code form; (ii) licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; (iii) redistributable at no charge; or (iv) subject to any FOSS licensing terms or obligations. As used above, “**FOSS**” or “**Free and Open Source Software**” means any software that is subject to terms that, as a condition of use, copying, modification, or redistribution, requires such software and derivative works thereof to be disclosed or distributed in source code form, to be licensed for the purpose of making derivatives works, or to be redistributed at no charge, including software distributed under the GNU General Public License or GNU Lesser General Public License (formerly known as “the GNU Library General Public License”) or any version thereof.

As between the parties, Licensor and its affiliates or licensors shall retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Product, including all Improvements thereto, and in all intellectual property rights therein, including as may be applicable, all patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secrets, whether registered or not registered. No license or other express or implied rights of any kind are granted or conveyed except for the limited internal license expressly provided above. As between Evaluator and Licensor, the Product shall remain Licensor’s sole and exclusive property.

Except as expressly provided herein, all rights are reserved by Licensor and its affiliates or licensors, as applicable.

## **6. TERMINATION.**

This Agreement will expire at the end of the Term, unless terminated earlier. Either party may terminate this Agreement earlier for convenience upon written notice to the other party (including via email). In addition, this Agreement will terminate immediately upon any breach by Evaluator. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Evaluator’s rights to use the Product shall immediately expire, Evaluator shall cease all use of the Product and delete all copies thereof, and an officer of Evaluator shall certify such deletion in writing to Licensor; otherwise, the terms and conditions of this Agreement will survive.
