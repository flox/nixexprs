error: In the definition of the pkgs.testPackage package in .*/test/pkgs/testPackage.nix, the argument testPackage itself is being used, which points to the unoverridden version of the same package. However, none of the channels are a valid option:
- flox: the package doesn't exist in this channel
- nixpkgs: this package doesn't exist in nixpkgs
- test: The super version can't come from its own channel
