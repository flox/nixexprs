trace: warning: In .*/test/pkgs/testPackage.nix, `flox.mkDerivation` is accessed, which is discouraged because it circumvents potential package conflicts between channels. Please use `mkDerivation` directly by adding it to the argument list at the top of the file if it doesn't exist already, and remove the `flox` argument. The `mkDerivation` argument contains the definitions from all channels and gives a conflict warning if multiple channels define the same package.
