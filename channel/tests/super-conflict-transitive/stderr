error: In the definition of the pkgs.foo package in .*/test/pkgs/foo.nix, the argument foo itself is being used, which points to the unoverridden version of the same package. However, none of the channels are a valid option:
- flox-lib: the package doesn't exist in this channel
- nixpkgs: this package doesn't exist in nixpkgs
- other: the package doesn't exist in this channel
- other2: the package exists in this channel, but it is not defined as a direct dependency
- test: The super version can't come from its own channel
