trace: warning: Channel name could not be inferred because all heuristics failed:
- chanArgs: No "name" defined in the floxpkgs default.nix
- cmdArgs: No "name" passed with `--argstr name <channel name>`
- baseName: topdir is in /nix/store, basename is nonsensical
- gitConfig: Path /nix/store/.*-test/.git/config does not exist
Using channel name "_unknown" instead. Because of this, channels dependent on your channel won't use your local uncommitted changes, and you will get failures if attempting to use sources from this channel.
